# CRUDS
# CRUDS Product Management System

## Description
The **CRUDS Product Management System** is a basic application that implements the standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete, and Search) for managing a product inventory. This project is ideal for beginners looking to practice fundamental programming skills such as handling user input, working with data structures, and performing common operations on data. It demonstrates how to store, update, and manipulate product data using simple algorithms, and provides an interactive interface for users to perform various tasks on the products.

This system is customizable and can be extended to handle more complex use cases such as integrating with databases or adding advanced search functionalities. The focus of this project is on understanding how CRUD operations work, and how to build a simple yet effective system for managing data.

## Features
- **Create**: Add new products with details like name, price, quantity, and category.
- **Read**: Display all products in the inventory.
- **Update**: Modify the details of existing products.
- **Delete**: Remove a specific product or clear all products from the system.
- **Search**: Search for products based on name or category.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C++ / JavaScript / Python
- **Interface**: Console-based or Web-based (depending on the version)
- **Data Storage**: In-memory or LocalStorage

## Learning Objectives
This project helps beginners improve their understanding of:
- Handling user input and output
- Working with arrays or lists
- Organizing code with functions or classes
- Implementing basic CRUD operations on data

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project directory.
3. Compile or run the main file:
   - For C++: Use a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ main.cpp -o app && ./app`)
   - For Python: Run with `python cruds.py`
   - For JavaScript: Open the `index.html` file in a browser

## Future Improvements
- Implement a database backend for persistent storage.
- Add user authentication for secure access.
- Validate user input and handle errors.
- Enhance the user interface with better styling or a graphical front end.
- Support exporting and importing product data (e.g., CSV or JSON format).
